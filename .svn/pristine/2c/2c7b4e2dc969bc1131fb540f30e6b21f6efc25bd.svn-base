Narrative:
As a player
I want to see the error message when I am logged out and try to place a bet
so that I know why a wager has not been placed

Scenario: QBM - Display validation error message when the user is logged out
Given user created the event with the  below data
 |GameId     |Sport  |League Id  |Status     |MarketTitle|MarketNameToCreate|
 |<GameId>   |<Sport>|<League Id>|<Status>   |<MarketTitle>|<MarketNameToCreate>|
When player navigates to above event
And QBM is activated
And player add a <<Selection>> from <<MarketTitle>> to the betslip
Then rejected class is applied to the selection <<Selection>> of market <<MarketTitle>>
And a generic error message 'You must be logged in to place a bet.' to be displayed


Examples:
|<GameId>   |<Sport>    |<League Id>    |<Status>    |<MarketNameToCreate>|<MarketTitle>     |<Selection>    |
|69501      |Football   |5              |In Progress |Outcome next play   |Extra Market 1    |Pass Completion|

Scenario: verify the outcome information(selection,Price,handicap) contained on the bet button for extra market

Given user created the event with the  below data
|GameId     |Sport  |Home Team  |Away Team  |League Id  |Status     |Description|MarketNameToCreate|MarketTitle|HandicapValue|
|<GameId>   |<Sport>|<Home Team>|<Away Team>|<League Id>|<Status>   |<Description>|<MarketNameToCreate>|<MarketTitle>|<HandicapValue>|
When user navigate to a Single Game View page of a Live Event <<GameId>>
Then the bet buttons of the market which has <<MarketTitle>> should display selection, price and <ExpectedHandicap>

Examples:
|<GameId>   |<Sport>    |<Home Team>    |<Away Team>    |<League Id>    |<Status>    |<Description>     |<MarketNameToCreate>|<MarketTitle>|<HandicapValue>|ExpectedHandicap|

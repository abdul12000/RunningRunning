Narrative:
As a player
I want the default stake amount selected to be remembered while I am logged in
so that I do not have to change the value for each wager that I place

Scenario: Default stake amount is remembered by user session
Given a player loggedIn and navigate to live betting page
And QBM is activated
When player introduced amount <Amount> in the default stake input field
And Bet slip mode is activated

Examples:
|Amount|
|10|

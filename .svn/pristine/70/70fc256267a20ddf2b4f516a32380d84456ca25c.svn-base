Scenario: verify V2Columns layout should be applied to the marketType 19

Given user created the event with the  below data
|GameId     |Sport  |Home Team  |Away Team  |League Id  |Status     |Description|MarketTitle|MarketNameToCreate|proptypeid|
|<GameId>   |<Sport>|<Home Team>|<Away Team>|<League Id>|<Status>   |<Description>|<MarketTitle>|<MarketNameToCreate>|<proptypeid>|

Narrative:
As a player
I want QBM toggle to be disabled when the wager are placed
so that I am aware that the betting mode cannot be changed while the wagers are placed


Scenario: Quick bet mode switch to be disabled when bet placement is being processed
Given user created the event with the  below data
|GameId     |Sport  |League Id  |Status     |MarketTitle|MarketNameToCreate      |
|<GameId>   |<Sport>|<League Id>|<Status>   |<MarketTitle>|<MarketNameToCreate>|
When a player loggedIn and navigate to above event
And Bet slip mode is activated
And player add a <<Selection>> from <<MarketTitle>> to the betslip
When player introduce the <risk> amount to the <<Selection>>
And clicks on place bet
Then betslip should display wager place message <Wager Placed msg>
And QBM should be in disabled state

Examples:
| <GameId> | <Sport>  | <Selection>     | risk | Username | Password | <MarketNameToCreate> | <MarketTitle>  | <League Id> | <Status>    | Placing Message |
| 67801    | Football | Pass Completion | 2    | 2393086  | testing  | Outcome next play    | Extra Market 1 | 5           | In Progress | Placing bets... |

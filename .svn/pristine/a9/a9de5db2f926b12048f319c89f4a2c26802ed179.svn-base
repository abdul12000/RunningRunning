Narrative:
As a player
I want arrows to be displayed close to input default stake field
so that I can select my preferred default stake amount

Lifecycle:
Before:
Given player is at live betting page
When Quick Bet Mode is activated

Scenario: Default stake amount is incremented when up arrow is selected
When I set the <Amount> and click on <Arrow> arrow
Then the amount in the default stake input field will be modified to <Expected Amount>

Examples:
| Amount | Arrow | <Expected Amount> |
| 6      | UP    | 7                 |
| 100    | UP    | 101               |
| 222    | UP    | 223               |
| 1000   | UP    | 1001              |
| 999    | UP    | 1000              |
| 0      | UP    | 1                 |
| 9998   | UP    | 9999              |
| 5999   | UP    | 6000              |
| 22     | UP    | 23                |
| 1507   | UP    | 1508              |
| 9999   | UP    | 9999              |

Scenario: Default stake amount is decreased when down arrow is selected
When I set the <Amount> and click on <Arrow> arrow
Then the amount in the default stake input field will be modified to <Expected Amount>

Examples:
| Amount | Arrow | <Expected Amount> |
| 6      | DOWN  | 5                 |
| 100    | DOWN  | 99                |
| 222    | DOWN  | 221               |
| 1000   | DOWN  | 999               |
| 999    | DOWN  | 998               |
| 1      | DOWN  | 0                 |
| 9998   | DOWN  | 9997              |
| 5999   | DOWN  | 5998              |
| 22     | DOWN  | 21                |
| 1507   | DOWN  | 1506              |
| 0      | DOWN  | 0                 |


Scenario: Corresponding button in default amount selector to be highlighted according to entered stake amount
When I set the <Amount> and click on <Arrow> arrow
Then the amount in the default stake input field will be modified to <Expected Amount>
And the relevant <Default stake selector> should be highlighted


Examples:
| Amount | Arrow | <Expected Amount> | <Default stake selector> |
| 6      | DOWN  | 5                 | 5                        |
| 4      | UP    | 5                 | 5                        |
| 2      | DOWN  | 1                 | 1                        |
